title: A new chapter - RISCV

Again, the same philosohpy - you want to learn something - implement it. 

So here I am, implementing RISC-V.

I got introduced to RISC-V watching Geo Hot Implementing RISC-V in Python. I have no
idea what's RISC-V or what's he doing at the time. But something about Geo Hot coding
something I completely don't understand really intrigue me. 

But Python is slow - and easy. I kinda wanna kill two birds with one stone so I
decided to implement RISC-V in a language I'm not comfortable with. And I finally
chose C. 

There's a blog I particularly like -
[fmash16](https://fmash16.github.io/content/posts/riscv-emulator-in-c.html)
which also happen in to be writen C. 

This shouldn't be impossible (at least I expect so) since I know a bit of assembly
and computer arch.
