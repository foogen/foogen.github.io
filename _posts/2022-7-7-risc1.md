title: RISC-V resources

Some of the resources for getting into RISC-V.

The bible, of couse, is the official
[ISA](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/) itself. 

But then, the bible may be hard and not so beginner friendly sometimes. So you can
instead approach other sources first and refer to the bible at the same time. 

* John Winans's RISC-V Assembly Language Programming
([link](https://github.com/johnwinans/rvalp/releases/tag/v0.16)). He also has a
Youtube channel.

* The RISC-V international Youtube Channel. I would watch some video by Yunsup Lee
first. 

* Dave Patterson's books. (I would look for leaked online PDF, they don't sell his
books where I live).

* George Hotz Twitchcore implementation (can be found on Youtube).
