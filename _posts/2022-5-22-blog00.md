<h4>Approach to learning blockchain (or anything in general)</h4>
This blog is written to document my learning process on the topic of blockchain. If you're a stranger who happened to come across this, you're welcome.<br>
I've heard the terms *blockchain* and *bitcoin* get thrown around the room for quite a while, with some vague images of blocks of data having arrows in between. Now it's my main goal to learn this piece of technology, but I hate watching videos of people talking about the vague mechanism of mining and all of that. Well the best one I've watched so far is 3Blues1Brown's blockchain, it covers a few concept and the general idea pretty well, but I'd like to know more about the technical side of things, like to actually code it.<br>
So that's my main approach, just try my best to implement a concept with Python, the code maybe terrible but I think it's a very effective way to learn a new piece of technology / concept.<br>
As of where I learn the concept, I try my best to painfully struggle through these papers:
<ul>
    <li>S. Nakamoto's Bitcoin paper - then turn to the *references page* you can dig back.</li>
    <li>Hashcat paper</li>
    <li>How to time-stamp a document (1991 or something)</li>
    <li>b-money</li>
    <li>Anything I able to dig up</li>
</ul>

So yeah, just do it. <br>
